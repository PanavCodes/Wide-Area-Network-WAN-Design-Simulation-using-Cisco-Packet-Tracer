# 🌐 Wide Area Network (WAN) Design Simulation using Cisco Packet Tracer

### 📄 Overview
This project presents the design and simulation of a **Wide Area Network (WAN)** using **Cisco Packet Tracer**.  
It connects multiple branch offices and a central headquarters, replicating a real-world enterprise network.  
The project demonstrates **dynamic routing (RIP)**, **Access Control Lists (ACLs)**, and various **network services** to enhance scalability, security, and efficiency.

---

### 🧠 Project Objectives
- Design and simulate a **multi-branch WAN topology**.
- Implement **Dynamic Routing (RIP)** to automate route updates.
- Apply **Access Control Lists (ACLs)** for network security.
- Configure and test **DNS, DHCP, FTP, and Email servers**.
- Verify end-to-end communication, routing efficiency, and data security.

### 🧩 Key Features
✅ Multi-branch WAN topology connecting HQ and branch offices  
✅ Dynamic Routing using **RIP**  
✅ Network security through **Access Control Lists (ACLs)**  
✅ **DHCP**, **DNS**, **FTP**, and **Mail server** configuration  
✅ Performance validation using **Ping tests, Packet Sniffer, and Efficiency Tests**  
✅ 0% packet loss verified in simulation

### 🛠️ Tools and Technologies
- **Cisco Packet Tracer** (Network Simulation)
- **Routing Protocol:** RIP (Dynamic Routing)
- **Security:** Access Control Lists (ACLs)
- **Services:** DHCP, DNS, FTP, SMTP/POP3 (Mail)
- **Testing Tools:** Ping, Packet Sniffer, and Simulation Mode

---

### 🧱 Network Architecture
The network connects:
- **Headquarters (HQ):** Central hub with core routers and servers  
- **Branch Office 1, 2, 3:** Remote LANs connected through serial links  
- **Redundant paths** between HQ and branches for fault tolerance  
- **Partial mesh topology** for alternative routing  

Each site includes:
- Routers, Switches, PCs, and Servers (Mail, DNS, FTP, DHCP, NTP)
- RIP for route exchange and automatic topology learning
- ACLs for restricting unauthorized network access

---

### 🔬 Testing and Validation
- ✅ **Connectivity Test:** Verified LAN-to-LAN communication  
- ✅ **DNS Resolution Test:** Successful name-to-IP translation  
- ✅ **Email Transfer Test:** Working cross-office mail delivery  
- ✅ **FTP File Transfer Test:** Large file transmission validated  
- ✅ **Packet Sniffer Analysis:** Confirmed data flow and ACL enforcement  
- ✅ **Efficiency Test:** 0% packet loss and successful data routing

### 🧾 Results
- Achieved fully functional WAN connectivity between all offices  
- Implemented **dynamic route discovery** and **automatic reconvergence**  
- Secured data access via ACLs  
- Ensured seamless inter-branch communication with zero packet loss  

---

### 🚀 Future Scope
- Migration to **Software-Defined WAN (SD-WAN)**  
- Implementation of **QoS policies** for VoIP/video prioritization  
- **VPN integration** for encrypted remote communication  
- Enhanced firewall and intrusion detection features  
- Expansion with **wireless LAN (WLAN)** and guest access
